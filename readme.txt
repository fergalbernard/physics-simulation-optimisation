The JavaScript simulation can be run by opening index.html (in the JavaScriptSim directory) in any browser.
It does not require a local server to be started.

The Unity simulation requires a local server. With python 3 installed, the following command should work (from the UnitySim directory):
python3 -m http.server --cgi 8360
The server should now be available at http://localhost:8360/
